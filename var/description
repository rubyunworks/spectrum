Spectrum is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace
manipulation support to applications that require it. It also provides 152
named RGB colours (184 with spelling variations) that are commonly supported
in HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A technique for generating monochromatic
contrasting palettes is also included.
